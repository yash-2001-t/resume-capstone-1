    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>I am an Electrical Engineering undergraduate student, and an aspiring web developer. I love creating things out of scratch, and hence web development seems like a natural next step for me. I am looking for internships in the web development field so that I can start getting hands-on experience working on tools and technology used in both frontend development and backend development.</p>
